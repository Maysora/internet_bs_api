A Rails Gem to allow for use of the Internet.bs reseller API in Ruby and Ruby
on Rails projects.

Currently this gem only supports US behavior. If anyone wants to enhance to
add other countries, that would be more than welcome.

Comments on each API call are taken directly from the Internet.bs Reseller API
documentation, current as of 11/23/2011. Please note that there are some
inconsistencies and if you want those cleared up refer to the document on their
site and/or query them.
